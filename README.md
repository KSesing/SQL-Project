# COVID-19 Data Exploration

## Project Overview
This SQL project explores COVID-19 data from a 2022 dataset, analyzing the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents. It demonstrates various SQL skills and techniques to derive insights from the data.

## Data Source
- 2022 COVID-19 dataset, divided into two main tables:
  1. CovidDeaths
  2. CovidVaccinations

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- Joins
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary Tables
- Window Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Views
- Data Type Conversion

## Key Analyses
1. Death percentage calculation for specific countries (e.g., South Africa)
2. Infection rates relative to population
3. Countries with highest infection rates
4. Countries with highest death count per population
5. Continent-wise analysis of death counts
6. Global COVID-19 numbers over time
7. Comparison of total population vs vaccinations
8. Percentage of population vaccinated over time

## Files in this Repository
- `SQLQueryProject.sql`: Contains all SQL queries used for the analysis


## Visualizations
The results of this analysis were visualized using Tableau. 
[(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kgotso.sesing/viz/CovidDashboardProject_17245256919200/Dashboard1?publish=yes)]



These findings provide valuable insights into the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting disparities in infection rates, mortality, and vaccination progress across different geographical areas.

## Future Work
- Incorporate more recent data for ongoing analysis
- Develop predictive models based on historical trends
- Expand analysis to include economic impact data
